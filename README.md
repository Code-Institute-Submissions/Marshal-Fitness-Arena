## DEPLOYMENT AND DEMO
Website has been deployed to [Github Pages](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/)

The skeletal framework of this website was designed using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com) as a visual guide to represent the page schematic and screen blueprint.

Links to final version of the wireframe can be found below:
* [Wireframe Final Version](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/wireframes/marshal-fitness-wireframe.pdf)

## UX
The focus here is ensuring that users find value in what the gym provides, more so it was a deliberate act to make it usable, useful, desirable, findable, credible and accessible

* Home Page: subtly displays an embed-responsive-16by9 video-style of unisex with dark overlay on top and the **About Us** information
* Gallery Page: maximizes Bootstrap4 Carousel to showcase the training ground cum gym facilities and the company's ethos
* Classes Page: a Grid system with inner card elements presents different classes and benefits
* Contact Page: Contact page contains a contact form for users with a google Map location

## User experience

![responsive](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/assets/images/responsive.png)

The website has been built to look great on both mobile and desktop devices with the exception of adding Javascript to implement complex features and interactive elements to enhance user experience.
The structure transforms accordingly across all devices. The colors were essential to communicate visual aesthetic state of mind to viewers, subconciously creating the urge to know more while conciously increasing the desire to gym at Marshal Fitness Arena.

I used [Tinypng](https://tinypng.com) which utilised smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of PNG and JPG files. This shrunk the image size to 41%.
the site uses less bandwith and load faster.

## FEATURES
* Background video on home page with dark overlay and and carousel-fade displaying motivational quotes to keep your eyes glued to the screen.
* Carousel-slide to showcase gym facilities in an enabling environment.
* Call-to-action buttons strategically positioned and escalated to get you signed Up.
* The call-to-action button triggers a chain reaction that cascades to the last point of call.
* Upon clicking the **Join Us Now!** button on any of the [Classes](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/classes.html) a modal form pops up with all the input components validated. 
  clicking **Submit** further triggers a second modal with a post-feedback success reaction depicted with thumbs-up, a fontawesome icon.
  The feedback modal can take you back to homepage upon clicking the web logo. 
  Again there's a line below the feedback modal customized to launch a quick follow-up call or enquiries.
* Fading overlay opacity effect on the card images upon hover displays the timetable for each class session.

## FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT 
* There is an urge to implement Javascript, like adding interactivity and automation. Things like video players, interactive maps and form validatiion can foster user experience.


## Visual identity
* [LogoMaker](https://logomaker.com) was used for the logo design
