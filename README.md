## User experience

<a href="https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/assets/images/responsive.png"><img src="assets/images/responsive.png" alt="responsive"></a>

I used <a href="https://tinypng.com">tinypng.com</a> which utilised smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of PNG and JPG files. This shrunk the image size to 41%.
the site uses less bandwith and load faster.
