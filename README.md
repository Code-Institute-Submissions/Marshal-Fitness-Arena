## User experience

![responsive](https://seagather.github.io/Marshal-Fitness-Arena/assets/images/responsive.png)

I used [tinypng](https://tinypng.com) which utilised smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of PNG and JPG files. This shrunk the image size to 41%.
the site uses less bandwith and load faster.
